# FanTimer

## Description
The **FanTimer** is an Arduino-based project designed to control a fan based on a user-defined timer. This project is particularly useful for situations where scheduled airflow is needed, such as in greenhouses, workshops, or home automation systems.

## Ideas and Benefits
The **FanTimer** offers several practical applications:

- **Home Automation**: Enables users to schedule fan operation, improving comfort without manual intervention.
- **Greenhouses**: Automates cooling for plants during hot periods, ensuring optimal growth conditions.
- **Workshops**: Maintains air circulation when working with materials that require ventilation, reducing fumes and enhancing comfort.

## Use Cases
- **Home Automation**: Cool the room before you arrive.
- **Temperature Regulation**: Schedule the fan to run during peak heat hours, providing a cooler environment without air conditioning.
- **Odor Control**: Automatically activate the fan after cooking or other odor-producing activities to maintain a fresh indoor atmosphere.
- **Cooking**: Ventilate the kitchen after cooking.
- **Pet Comfort**: Keep pets cool during hot days.
- **Grow Room**: Maintain optimal conditions for plants.
- **Allergy Management**: Circulate air to reduce allergens.
- **Dehumidification**: Reduce humidity in damp areas.
- **Event Preparation**: Cool the space before guests arrive.
- **Study Environment**: Create a comfortable study area.

## Usage Manual

### Keypad Controls
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| 0-9 | Enter Time | Input numbers to set the timer duration in seconds |
| A | Start Timer | Begin the countdown with the set duration |
| B | Pause/Resume | Toggle between pausing and resuming the timer |
| C | Reset | Clear the current time and reset the timer |
| D | Quick Add | Add 10 seconds to the current time |
| # | Show Credits | Display creator information |

### Basic Operation
1. **Setting the Time**: 
   - Use the numeric keys (0-9) to enter your desired duration in seconds
   - The time will be displayed on the LCD screen

2. **Timer Controls**:
   - Press 'A' to start the countdown
   - Press 'B' to pause/resume the timer
   - Press 'C' to reset everything
   - Press 'D' to quickly add 10 seconds
   - Press '#' to view creator credits

3. **Fan Operation**:
   - The fan will automatically start when the timer reaches zero
   - The fan will run for 5 seconds and then stop
   - The system will return to the time entry mode

## Code
The Arduino code responsible for controlling the FanTimer can be found in the file **`FanTimerArduino1.ino`**. This code handles user input from a keypad, manages timer functionality, and controls the fan operation.

## Components
The project consists of the following components:
- **Arduino Uno R3**: The main microcontroller board.
- **MCP23008-based, 32 (0x20) LCD 16 x 2 (I2C)**: For displaying timer values and status messages.
- **Keypad 4x4**: To input time and control the timer.
- **DC Motor**: Acts as the fan.
